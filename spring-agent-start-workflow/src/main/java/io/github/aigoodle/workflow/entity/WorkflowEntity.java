/**
 * A stored workflow definition (its graph as JSON). Aligned with Dify's shape:
 * every workflow row belongs to an app ({@link #appId}) and has a
 * {@link #version} string that is either {@code "draft"} (the mutable working
 * copy — exactly one per app) or a semver-ish snapshot label like {@code "1.0"}
 * / {@code "1.1"} etc. Publishing a draft copies its {@link #graphJson} into a
 * new immutable row with a numeric version; the draft row itself is never
 * replaced, so {@code apps.workflow_id} keeps pointing at the same id and
 * subsequent edits keep hitting the same durable id.
 *
 * <p>The four JSON side-channels ({@link #features}, {@link #environmentVariables},
 * {@link #conversationVariables}, {@link #output}) mirror Dify's schema so
 * downstream code (feature toggles, env-var scoping, structured output) can be
 * layered on later without another schema rewrite.</p>
